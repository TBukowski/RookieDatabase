@*@model IEnumerable<RookieDatabase.ViewModels.RookieViewModel>*@
@model RookieDatabase.ViewModels.RookieViewModel
@*
    use positionviewmodel instead of rookieviewmodel
    remember that helper method in the controller that I created called GetPageMessage
    use that to set a new property on the view model which you can use to the set title.
    the view will not know what position here...it will need to look into the view model*@
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Position";
}

@*This type of property is what I was talking about in my comment above. This is pretty much what you need. Just one problem, you're trying to use it here
    and it is not a property on position viewmodel*@
<h1>@Model.Position</h1>
<h2>POSITION PAGE</h2>
<p>
    <a asp-action="AddPlayer">Add a new rookie</a>
</p>
@*
    @foreach (var rookie in )
    {
        <h2>@Model.Position</h2>
        <h2>@Model.PlayerName</h2>
    }

        -Line 14 is incorrect and needs an enumerable of position specific rookies
        -Right now I want to just get the razor working and create the correct list (or whatever)
        -i can do table on my own

        -This page will consist of a table resembling the roster view in the Madden game and
        will only hold one position grouping. (eadh position will have its own page)
        -A title with the position name
        -A search bar
        -Player name link to player specific edit
